This is a C assignment for the HUST C Course.

This is an application to manage the donation information.

## WARNING!!!

If you are one of the freshmen in HUST and are struggling to finish the assignment, you are certainly free to turn to this project for reference. However, DO NOT COPY ANY CODE SNIPPETS.

## HOW-to build

To build this project, you will need a copy of qt installed. I am using Qt 5.9.1 (GCC).

Once you have Qt installed, just click the green button and you are good to go.
